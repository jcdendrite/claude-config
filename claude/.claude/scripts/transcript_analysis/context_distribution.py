    """Per-session peak context, bucketed two ways — grounds a handoff-nudge
    threshold choice against measured sessions instead of picking one blind.

    Peak-context tracking is restricted to main-thread (non-sidechain) turns:
    a subagent dispatch pays its own prefix from scratch and is never a
    candidate for /handoff, so folding sidechain turns into a session's peak
    would mix two different context-growth stories into one number. Each
    main-thread turn's context_at_turn (input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens
    + ephemeral_1h + ephemeral_5m, from _price_turn, same formula cost's own
    bucket logic uses) feeds two independent per-session maxima, tracked by
    _session_peak_context:
    - peak_pct: context_at_turn expressed as a fraction of that turn's own
      model's context window via _context_window_for_model — so a session
      that mixes models with different windows is judged by how close each
      turn came to its own model's limit, not a single window assumed for
      the whole session. Reported against
      _CONTEXT_DISTRIBUTION_THRESHOLD_PCTS.
    - peak_abs_tokens: context_at_turn plus that turn's output_tokens — the
      same four-field sum nudge-handoff-near-context-cap.sh's own ESTIMATE
      computes, so a threshold read off this table transfers directly to the
      hook's unit. Reported against _CONTEXT_DISTRIBUTION_THRESHOLD_ABS.
    Neither is derived from the other (peak_abs_tokens != peak_pct * window):
    on a session mixing a 200k-window turn with a 1M-window turn, the turn
    with the highest percentage of its own window need not be the turn with
    the highest absolute token count.

    Dollar totals per session sum ALL turns (main and sidechain), matching
    cost's own definition of a session's total spend — a session's dollar
    share reflects its full cost including any subagent work it spawned, not
    just its main-thread portion.
