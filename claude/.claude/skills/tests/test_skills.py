"""Static contract tests for specialist skill SKILL.md description fields.

Each specialist skill in this repo is auto-triggerable: the Claude Code harness
reads the frontmatter `description` field at session start and loads the skill
body when the description matches the current context. The TRIGGER when: /
DO NOT TRIGGER when: blocks inside that description are the routing contracts.

These tests verify the contracts without invoking Claude Code or the API:
- Both TRIGGER when: and DO NOT TRIGGER when: blocks are present in the description.
- The TRIGGER block covers the file surface or intent the skill owns.
- The DO NOT TRIGGER block names the adjacent skill whose surface overlaps.

A silent regression (dropping a surface glob or an adjacent-skill exclusion
from the description) means the skill either stops firing on its surface or
dual-fires with a neighbor. These tests catch that at CI time.

Run with: pytest claude/.claude/
