# Trimmed shared helper library for plugin-semver plugin hooks.
# Source this file (do NOT invoke it). Contains only the helper needed by
# the PreToolUse gate hook in this plugin: _lib_jq and
# _lib_parse_tool_input_or_deny. No git helpers, no marker helpers, no
# worktree-enforcement helpers — require-plugin-version-bump.sh is a
# structural check, not a marker gate (see that file's header).

# Backstop against a hung jq (~5s, not a per-fire latency budget).
# Cites guard-settings-session-keys.sh's git_capped 5s precedent.
# Fallback to bare jq when timeout(1) is absent (BSD/macOS default).
# install.sh warns about missing timeout at onboarding time.
# Security implication: on BSD/macOS without coreutils, a stalled or
# replaced jq binary can hold a gate hook open indefinitely. The harness's
# own hook timeout (if any) then governs — not this wrapper.

# Reads stdin into INPUT (global), extracts TOOL_NAME and COMMAND (globals)
# via a single _lib_jq call using ASCII Unit Separator (0x1f) as delimiter.
# The single call surfaces a structural-type error when .tool_input is non-object
# (jq non-zero exit).
#
# Three deny paths protect against silent-allow:
#   (a) jq non-zero exit (parse failure, timeout exit=124, missing jq binary)
#   (b) empty INPUT (stdin EOF, closed pipe, harness misbehavior)
#   (c) empty TOOL_NAME (valid JSON but PreToolUse contract not honored, e.g. "{}")
# Per Anthropic PreToolUse contract, every legitimate event has a non-empty
# .tool_name; absence indicates the call did not originate from a real tool
# invocation. Without (b)/(c), downstream gates that early-exit on
# `[ "$TOOL_NAME" = "Bash" ]` silently allow on zero-byte or "{}" inputs.
#
# Contract: if this function returns, parse succeeded AND TOOL_NAME is set.
# On failure, calls emit_deny (caller-defined) with the supplied message and
# exits 0 — caller never checks $?. Never call this with `|| true` or in
# a pipeline. CALLER MUST define emit_deny before sourcing _lib.sh so this
# helper can resolve it; the canonical pattern (define-emit_deny-then-source)
# is enforced by test_hook_alignment.py.
