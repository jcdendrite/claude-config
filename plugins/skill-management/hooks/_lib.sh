# Trimmed shared helper library for skill-management plugin hooks.
# Source this file (do NOT invoke it). Contains only the helpers needed by
# require-skill-review.sh: _lib_jq, _lib_parse_tool_input_or_deny,
# _marker_lib_repo_hash, and _lib_chains_marker_write_before_commit. No git
# helpers, no worktree-enforcement helpers.
#
# _marker_lib_repo_hash must stay byte-identical to the same function in the
# stowed claude/.claude/hooks/_lib.sh — marker.sh (the write side) always
# sources the stowed copy directly ($HOME/.claude/hooks/_lib.sh), never a
# plugin-bundled one, so a divergence here breaks the repo-hash used to key
# markers between the write side and this hook's read side.

# Backstop against a hung jq (~5s, not a per-fire latency budget).
# Cites guard-settings-session-keys.sh's git_capped 5s precedent.
# Fallback to bare jq when timeout(1) is absent (BSD/macOS default).
# install.sh warns about missing timeout at onboarding time.
# Security implication: on BSD/macOS without coreutils, a stalled or
# replaced jq binary can hold a gate hook open indefinitely. The harness's
# own hook timeout (if any) then governs — not this wrapper.

# Reads stdin into INPUT (global), extracts TOOL_NAME and COMMAND (globals)
# via a single _lib_jq call using ASCII Unit Separator (0x1f) as delimiter.
# The single call surfaces a structural-type error when .tool_input is non-object
# (jq non-zero exit).
#
# Three deny paths protect against silent-allow:
#   (a) jq non-zero exit (parse failure, timeout exit=124, missing jq binary)
#   (b) empty INPUT (stdin EOF, closed pipe, harness misbehavior)
#   (c) empty TOOL_NAME (valid JSON but PreToolUse contract not honored, e.g. "{}")
# Per Anthropic PreToolUse contract, every legitimate event has a non-empty
# .tool_name; absence indicates the call did not originate from a real tool
# invocation. Without (b)/(c), downstream gates that early-exit on
# `[ "$TOOL_NAME" = "Bash" ]` silently allow on zero-byte or "{}" inputs.
#
# Contract: if this function returns, parse succeeded AND TOOL_NAME is set.
# On failure, calls emit_deny (caller-defined) with the supplied message and
# exits 0 — caller never checks $?. Never call this with `|| true` or in
# a pipeline. CALLER MUST define emit_deny before sourcing _lib.sh so this
# helper can resolve it; the canonical pattern (define-emit_deny-then-source)

# Decide whether a command chains `marker.sh write <skill>` before its first
# `git commit`. PreToolUse hooks fire once per Bash tool call before the chain
# runs, so an on-disk marker check denies naturally-typed forms like
# `marker.sh write code-review && git commit`. When the same Bash call will
# write the marker before invoking commit, the in-chain marker.sh invocation
# is the same evidence the on-disk marker would later provide — marker.sh is
# the only sanctioned writer in either case.
#
# **Anchored at command start, not fragment start.** A fragment-walking
# approach (split on `&&` / `;` / `|`, then scan each fragment) would treat
# heredoc-body lines and wrapper-command arguments as "fragments" — so
# `echo ~/.claude/scripts/marker.sh write code-review && git commit` or
# `cat <<EOF | bash\n...marker.sh write code-review\nEOF && git commit` would
# wedge the gate open without ever actually invoking marker.sh. The strict
# command-start anchor here mirrors enforce-marker-script-shape.sh's
# VALID_CHAINED_COMMIT_PATTERN: only the literal shape
# `marker.sh write <skill>{,&& marker.sh write <skill2>...} && git commit`
# is honored. Wrapper commands, env-var prefixes, `bash -c`, heredoc bodies,
# and pipes all fail the anchor.
#
# Usage: _lib_chains_marker_write_before_commit "$COMMAND" code-review
# Returns 0 (true) if the command matches the sanctioned chained shape AND
# the target skill appears among the chained writes.
_lib_chains_marker_write_before_commit() {

  # enforce-marker-script-shape.sh's VALID_CHAINED_COMMIT_PATTERN). One or
  # more marker.sh write fragments joined by `&&`, then git commit. Anchored
  # so wrapper commands cannot trick the gate.
